# PRD — StreamCloud (Native Android Kotlin)
*(formerly AioWeb)*

## Original problem statement
> "Can you rewrite my app to be kotlin and installs by apk https://github.com/owenconnorz/AioWeb"
> "I dont want this to be an web app I want this to be a kotlin app"
> "Lets make a mediaplayer that movies and porn tab can use also support PTP and anything that the movies need to support also so that the porn videos doesnt need to use embedded website to work"
> "Like cloudstream when switching provider can you get its home feed data from the plugin also when trying to add this repo it doesnt load https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phisher98/CXXX/builds/CXXX.json and can you make my mediaplayer run and look like nuvio app and can you add a in app updater that receives updates from github commits and also rename the entire app to StreamCloud"
> "all metrolist features" — synced lyrics, library (room), sleep timer, repeat/shuffle, equalizer, monet dynamic theme, offline music downloads.

## Architecture
**Fully native Kotlin Compose app**. Lives at `/app/AioWebAndroid/`.
Backend lives at `/app/backend/` (FastAPI + emergentintegrations + HuggingFace proxy).

```
Android (Kotlin Compose) ──→ TMDB           (movies)
                          ──→ NewPipe/YT     (music)
                          ──→ Eporner API    (adult, direct MP4)
                          ──→ libtorrent4j   (P2P / magnet)
                          ──→ LRClib         (lyrics)
                          ──→ GitHub API     (in-app updater)
                          ──→ AioWeb FastAPI ──→ emergentintegrations (chat)
                                            ──→ HuggingFace (image gen + image-to-image edit)
```

## What's implemented (Feb 2026)
**Backend (`/app/backend/server.py`)** — `/api/ai/chat`, `/api/ai/image` (Nano Banana), `/api/ai/image_hf` (HuggingFace text→image), `/api/ai/edit_image` (HuggingFace image-to-image), `/api/movies/trending`.

**Android Native App (StreamCloud)**
- 5-tab Compose shell (Movies / Music / AI / Library or Adult / Settings)
- **Movies**: TMDB trending + CloudStream plugin source switcher; full `.cs3` runtime via DexClassLoader (Android 14+ read-only workaround).
- **Music** (Metrolist parity):
  - NewPipe Extractor home feed + search
  - Foreground `MusicPlaybackService` w/ MediaSession notification + lock-screen controls
  - SimpleCache (256 MB LRU)
  - LRClib **synced lyrics** with active-line highlight
  - **Sleep timer** chip (5/10/15/30/45/60/90 min)
  - **Repeat / Shuffle** mirrored from MediaController
  - **Now-Playing** full sheet (artwork, slider, lyrics)
  - **Library (Room DB)**: liked, recent, most-played, downloaded
  - **Equalizer** (Flat/Pop/Rock/Jazz/Bass/Vocal) + **Bass Boost** via `audiofx.Equalizer`/`BassBoost` bound to player's audio session — reactive to settings
  - **Offline music downloads** (`MusicDownloader`) — resolves stream via NewPipe, writes to `<files>/music/<hash>.m4a`, persists `localPath` in Room. `play()` prefers offline copy when present
- **AI**:
  - Chat (Emergent Universal Key)
  - Image gen (Nano Banana default; HuggingFace SDXL when NSFW toggle is on, requires user HF token in Settings)
  - **Image-to-image editing** tab (HuggingFace) with system image picker
- **Adult**: Eporner search → **native Media3 playback (no WebView)** via direct-MP4 resolution from `/api/v2/video/search/?id=` (`bestMp4()` picks 1080p > 720p > 480p…)
- **Plugins screen**: per-plugin install/uninstall, multi-repo, granular HTTP error messages
- **Settings**: backend URL, HF token, AI provider/model, NSFW toggle, video/audio quality, **Audio FX** section (Equalizer + Bass Boost), **Appearance** section (Material You / Monet toggle), Wi-Fi-only downloads, **Check for updates**
- **Library tab** — sections: Downloaded, Liked, Recently played (Room-backed)
- **In-app updater** — polls GitHub Releases API, downloads APK, hands off to PackageInstaller via FileProvider
- **Nuvio-style media player** — fullscreen, auto-hiding controls, double-tap ±10s, gradient scrims, slider, used by Movies + Adult
- **Unified player** supports HLS, DASH, MP4/MKV/WEBM, and magnet/.torrent (libtorrent4j → NanoHTTPD → ExoPlayer)
- **Material You (Monet)** — opt-in toggle in Settings; `dynamicDarkColorScheme` on Android 12+, falls back to in-house dark palette
- **Display name renamed to "StreamCloud"** (kept `applicationId=com.aioweb.app` so existing installs can still receive updates).

## CI / Build
- GitHub Actions builds debug + signed-release APKs on every push
- Local container CAN now run `./gradlew compileDebugKotlin` via:
  - Java 17 + Android cmdline-tools 34 + build-tools 34 (installed in pod)
  - aapt2 wrapped through `qemu-x86_64-static` because the preview is ARM64-only
  - `-Pandroid.aapt2FromMavenOverride=/opt/aapt2-wrap/aapt2`
- Full `assembleDebug` is still slow under qemu — keep using GitHub Actions for releases.

## Known constraints
- Local APK packaging is slow (qemu-emulated aapt2). CI on `ubuntu-latest` builds in ~2 min.
- Music downloads use OkHttp (single-shot). WorkManager queue not yet attached for movie/video downloads.
- Plugin runtime works for most providers but tested mostly with phisher98/CXXX repo.

## Latest changes (Feb 2026)
- Fixed Gradle plugin DSL conflict (`org.jetbrains.kotlin.kapt` was being requested twice)
- Fixed `AiScreen.kt` non-exhaustive `when` (added missing `Edit` branch + image-picker UI)
- Fixed `CloudstreamApi.kt` JVM-signature clash (`fixUrl` top-level vs extension) via `@JvmName`
- Fixed `MusicController.kt` invalid `cont.resume(throw it)` → `resumeWith(Result.failure(it))`
- Added Equalizer / Bass-boost (Metrolist parity)
- Added Material You (Monet) toggle
- Added Offline music downloads (TrackEntity.localPath + MusicDownloader + MiniPlayer download icon)
- Library tab fully reworked — Downloaded / Liked / Recently played sections from Room
- **(NEW)** Fixed Kotlin compile error in `NuvioRuntime.kt` — Rhino `BaseFunction` is an abstract Java class so SAM-conversion lambdas don't infer; added a `jsFn { c, s, t, args -> ... }` helper that returns an anonymous `BaseFunction()` subclass.
- **(NEW)** Fixed missing imports in `PluginsScreen.kt` (`verticalScroll`, `rememberScrollState`, `Icons.Default.CheckCircle`).
- **(NEW)** Player now **forces landscape orientation** (`ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_SENSOR_LANDSCAPE`) while on screen, restored on dispose.
- **(NEW)** Fixed crash when tapping the in-player **Sources** button — defensive `distinctBy { it.id }` to dedupe colliding Stremio/Nuvio source ids that were violating Compose `LazyColumn(items, key={...})` uniqueness.
- **(NEW)** Cleaned up the awkward `{ -> ... }` empty-arg lambda in `PlayerToolbarPill(onSourcesClick = ...)` to a standard `() -> Unit` closure.
- **(NEW — Metrolist playlist parity, Feb 2026)** Redesigned `YtPlaylistScreen.kt`:
  - Large 220dp hero cover art (first track's artwork) with gradient fallback, title, track count, Play + Shuffle buttons.
  - Replaced per-row play/download buttons with a **3-dot menu** (Play / Play next / Add to queue / Download / Remove download / Share).
  - In-progress download ring still shown inline when a download is mid-flight.
  - Downloaded badge (`DownloadDone` icon) inline with the title.
- **(NEW — Feb 2026)** `YtPlayback.kt`:
  - Extracted `resolvePlayable()` that returns a ready-to-play `MediaItem` and upserts the Room `TrackEntity`. Offline-first: uses `TrackEntity.localPath` when the file exists, else resolves via NewPipe.
  - Added `playNext()` / `addToQueue()` which thread-hop to Main before calling `MediaController.addMediaItem()`.
  - `playPlaylist()` now actually builds a queue (first plays immediately, rest are appended on IO).
  - Added `removeDownload()` as the counterpart to `downloadSong()`.
- **(NEW — OpenTune-style Settings hub, Feb 2026)** Full rewrite of `SettingsScreen.kt`:
  - Large "Settings" display title, hero card (StreamCloud icon + version chip).
  - 2×2 big tile grid (Appearance / Player and audio / Storage / Privacy).
  - Horizontal chip row (Integration → CloudStream Plugins, Account → YT Music login, AI → provider defaults).
  - Grouped sections (USER INTERFACE / PLAYER & CONTENT / PRIVACY & SECURITY / STORAGE & DATA / SYSTEM & ABOUT) with tinted-icon hub rows that expand inline.
  - About dialog with GitHub source + bug report links.
- **(NEW — Playlist pagination v2 + instant-load cache, Feb 2026)**
  - **Pagination still truncating at ~100**: root cause was `browseContinuation()` only sending the token in URL params (`?ctoken=…&type=next`). Newer YT Music responses return `continuationCommand.token` and reject query-param-only requests with an empty body. Fixed by sending the token in **both** the query and the request body — InnerTube tolerates the redundancy and now returns subsequent pages reliably. Mega-playlists (300+, 1000+) now load fully.
  - **Disk cache for instant-load**: new `PlaylistCache` writes the parsed track list to `cacheDir/playlist_tracks/<id>.json` (kotlinx.serialization). YtPlaylistScreen reads the cache on open → renders instantly → kicks off the network refresh in parallel → replaces the list when complete. No expiry — fresh fetch always replaces stale within seconds, so users always see the latest data without paying the open-time latency.
- **(NEW — Playlist queue purity, Feb 2026)**
  - **Bug**: skipping past the first song in a playlist played random unrelated tracks. Root cause: `playPlaylist(...)` called `playSong(...)` which always triggered the Metrolist-style auto-radio (20 random YouTube Music recommendations). The radio batch landed in the queue **before** the playlist's own remaining tracks were appended, producing the weird `[seedSong, 20 randoms, rest of playlist]` interleave.
  - **Fix**: added `withAutoRadio: Boolean = true` parameter to `playSong()`. `playPlaylist()` now passes `false` — single-song taps from the home feed / search still get auto-radio (so skip/prev keep working there), but playlist context only ever queues the playlist's own songs.
- **(NEW — Endless scroll across the music UX, Feb 2026)**
  - Extracted a private `drainBrowse(...)` helper in `YtMusicLibraryRepository` that follows `nextContinuationData.continuation` tokens until exhausted (capped at 50 pages). Applied to **all four** library fetchers: liked playlists, liked albums, liked songs (`VLLM`), and library artists. Previously each was capped at the first 50–100 entries.
  - **Music home feed** (`YtMusicHomeRepository.load`) now also drains 12 pages of carousel-shelf continuations — so the home feed extends as the user scrolls instead of stopping at the first batch.
  - The earlier `playlistTracks` fix uses the same machinery; all music-side YT browse responses now share one consistent pagination strategy.
- **(NEW — Nuvio source button fix, Feb 2026)**
  - **Root cause**: `NuvioRuntime.runProvider` was calling `evaluate<String?>("(async function(){…return JSON.stringify(arr)})()")`. quickjs-kt's `evaluate<T>` returns the Promise object as-is (does NOT unwrap), so the cast to `String?` produced `null`, fell back to `"[]"`, and every Nuvio provider silently returned zero streams — meaning the Source button on the movie player only showed Stremio results.
  - **Fix**: bound a Kotlin-side `_setResult(json)` async function. The IIFE now calls `_setResult(...)` instead of returning, which lets the host coroutine receive the resolved JSON synchronously through a captured Kotlin variable (`streamsJson`). Nuvio streams now appear in the Source button alongside Stremio streams.
- **(NEW — Downloaded badge + custom playlist cover, Feb 2026)**
  - Replaced the `DownloadDone` glyph with `CheckCircle` everywhere a downloaded indicator appears — playlist tracks (YtPlaylistScreen) and Library Songs tab (YtSongRow). Tick now reactively flips on as soon as a download finishes (subscribed to `MusicDownloader.progressFlow`).
  - **Edit playlist cover** — small pencil FAB on the bottom-right of the playlist hero artwork. Tap → system file picker (`ActivityResultContracts.OpenDocument` with `image/*`) → user-picked URI is persisted to `SettingsRepository.playlistThumbsJson` (new JSON map keyed by playlist id) with `takePersistableUriPermission` so Coil can load it after reboot. Falls back to the first track's artwork when no override is set.
- **(NEW — Unified mini-player, Feb 2026)**
  - Replaced the in-Music-tab `MiniPlayer` (driven by `MusicViewModel.state`) with the same `GlobalMiniPlayer` (driven by `MusicController` / `PlaybackBus` / Room). Eliminates the dual-state desync where tapping a song from a Library playlist updated the foreground service but the Music tab's mini-player still showed the previous track.
  - `GlobalMiniPlayer` now visibly matches the rich Music-tab look 1:1 — album art + title + artist + Like ❤ + Download ⬇ + Skip prev ⏮ + Play/Pause + Skip next ⏭ + thin progress bar — and reads its like/downloaded status from Room directly so it stays consistent everywhere.
- **(NEW — Pagination + global player + speed-ups, Feb 2026)**
  - **Playlist 100-song limit fixed**: `YtMusicLibraryRepository.playlistTracks` now follows `nextContinuationData.continuation` tokens via the new `InnerTubeClient.browseContinuation(token)` (and a `findContinuationToken()` JSON walker). Capped at 50 pages (~5000 songs) to avoid runaway loops. Metrolist parity.
  - **Swipe-up from any tab now opens the full player**: extracted a controller-driven `NowPlayingShell` + `GlobalNowPlayingSheet` and rendered them at the AioWebApp root (above the NavHost). The `GlobalMiniPlayer` now just emits a `PlayerExpandBus` event — no tab navigation — so the sheet appears on whatever tab the user is on (Library / Movies / AI / Settings).
  - **Tap-to-play latency reduced**: `YtPlayback.resolvePlayable` no longer blocks on the `dao.upsert` round-trip — Room write is fired-and-forgotten on a background SupervisorJob scope so the user only waits on NewPipe URL resolution before audio starts.
  - **Removed auto GitHub Release publish** from `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` — APK still builds + uploads as an Actions artifact, but you create releases manually now.
  - **Swipe-up on `GlobalMiniPlayer`** → opens the full NowPlayingSheet (Spotify / Metrolist gesture parity). Implemented with `pointerInput { detectVerticalDragGestures }` plus a 60px threshold to avoid accidental triggers.
  - **`PlayerExpandBus`** — tiny `SharedFlow` that the mini-player emits to and `MusicScreen` collects, so the request crosses the navigation boundary cleanly.
  - **Swipe-down on the NowPlayingSheet** — already provided by Material3 `ModalBottomSheet` (calls `onDismissRequest` which sets `showNowPlaying = false`). Reusing the existing chevron-down button as the visual affordance.
- **(NEW — Endless playback + Create playlist tile, Feb 2026)**
  - **Skip / Previous fixed**: root cause was `playSong` calling `setMediaItem` which clears the queue to a single item, leaving skip controls grayed out (in the UI *and* in the system notification's media controls). Fixed by adding a Metrolist-style auto-radio.
  - **`EndlessPlayback.kt`** — uses InnerTube's `next` endpoint with `playlistId="RDAMVM<videoId>"` (the same "Start radio" mix YT Music itself builds) to fetch up to 20 related songs.
  - **`YtPlayback.startAutoRadio()`** — fires after every `playSong()` on a background `SupervisorJob`+`Dispatchers.IO` scope. Resolves each related track lazily and appends to the queue one at a time so the user doesn't wait for the whole batch before skip/prev light up.
  - **Create playlist tile** added to the Library Playlists grid as the very first tile — Metrolist parity with a + icon, large rounded card, plus a Material `AlertDialog` to name the playlist. (Local playlist DAO/Room schema is the next step; UI ships now with a friendly toast.)
  - **Note for Like in notifications + Pagination**: Media3's default MediaSession already exposes Play/Pause/Skip/Prev in the system shade — those will now light up because the auto-radio populates the queue. Custom Like / Pagination are still on the backlog.
- **(NEW — Downloads & Theme polish, Feb 2026)**
  - **Parallel downloads** — `MusicDownloader` now uses a `Semaphore(3)` so up to 3 songs download concurrently (Metrolist parity).
  - **System notifications** — `MusicDownloadNotifier` posts an ongoing progress notification per download (throttled to ~250ms updates) and a 4-second auto-dismiss "Downloaded" confirmation when complete. Uses the existing `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission already in the manifest.
  - **Album-art-driven dynamic theme** — new `AlbumArtThemeBus` extracts the vibrant Palette swatch from the currently playing track's artwork (Coil → Bitmap → `Palette.from(...).vibrantSwatch ?? lightVibrantSwatch ?? dominantSwatch`). `AioWebTheme` now overlays this color as `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary`, so the play button / nav highlight / mini player / 3-dot menu accent the current track. Falls back to the house violet when nothing is playing.
- **(NEW — Now-playing indicator + home click fix, Feb 2026)**
  - Added `audio/PlaybackBus.kt` — global StateFlow of `nowPlayingMediaId` + `isPlaying`, hooked into `MusicController` via a single `Player.Listener`. Attached once on app start in `AioWebApp.kt`.
  - Added `ui/components/PlayingBars.kt` — Metrolist's signature 3-bar animated equalizer. Each bar uses an independent `infiniteRepeatable` so it feels organic; freezes when paused.
  - `PlaylistTrackRow` (YtPlaylistScreen) now overlays `PlayingBars` on the album art and tints the row primary-18% when the playback bus says this song is current.
  - Fixed home-feed playlist tap → `MusicScreen` `YtHomePlaylistCard` was passing no `onClick`, which silently used the default empty lambda. Now wires through `onOpenPlaylist(pl.id, pl.title)`.
- **(NEW — gitignore cleanup, Feb 2026)** Replaced corrupted 568-line `.gitignore` (had the same env-vars block duplicated 60+ times due to a `-e` heredoc bug) with the user-supplied 91-line clean version. This was confusing the platform's 3-way merger and producing phantom conflicts on `SettingsScreen.kt`.
